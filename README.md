# Awesome Flex Plugins ðŸš€

This is a list of Flex Plugins that I have gathered along the way, based on common customers' questions.

It can be used as a first place to take a look before starting building a Plugin as it could be that someone else already has built it.

## Flex Plugins

### Flex Station Selector

- **What is is:** A plugin that changes allows Agents in Flex to receive the calls not on Flex UI but, instead, on his/her own cellphone, for example. It is good for cases when the internet connection of the Agent is not so good. SIP Softphone is also possible.

- **Resources:** [Github repo](https://github.com/jlafer/plugin-station-selector) and [Demo video](https://www.loom.com/share/c441e0e4cb6f4b7696ae46f5dbf5e73a)

- Hashtags for easy finding: `charlie`, `contact_uri`

### Put Agents Offline

- **What is is:** A plugin that puts the Agents offline every day at 21:00. Good for customers based on Per Hour pricing model on Flex, avoiding expenses that run overnight just because an Agent forgot to put himself/herself offline after work.

### Integration with a custom CRM

- **What is is:** This plugin shows in a primitive way how to embed Flex into any CRM. I used the SAP as a CRM example but there is no element of SAP there, it is purely an example of integration of Flex into any other website and this Plugin can be used as a starting point to integrate Flex into your website.

### Post-call after a bad Survey

- **What is is:** This plugin is an example of how your system can create an outbound call for a Customer, showing some information on the Agent's screen before the call happens. Use-case is when your customer went to your website, bought something, and at the end, there is a survey about the process this customer just faced - for all the bad NPS scores on this survey, you can immediately generate a task for the next available agent to call this customer to know more about the bad experience this customer had, and try to revert this.

## Scripts

### Delete Agents after 30 days of inactivity

- **What is is:** This is a Script that should run every night, looking for Agents who haven't logged into Flex for more than 30 days. Good for customers based on Per Seat pricing model on Flex, avoiding extra expenses for Agents who are not in the company anymore.

- **Resources:** [Github repo](https://github.com/bruno222/twilio-flex-delete-workers-after-x-days)

- Hashtags for easy finding: `sso`, `github actions`

## Snippets

### Custom Notification

- **What is is:** Show a custom alert/notification for the Agent.

- **Resources:** [Doc](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/ui/notifications)

```
    manager.strings.voiceAlert = "Possible voice network quality issue detected: {{issueStr}}"
    flex.Notifications.registerNotification({
    id: "VoiceWarning",
    content: "voiceAlert",
    type: flex.NotificationType.error
    });

    flex.Notifications.showNotification("VoiceWarning", {issueStr: "testing issue"});
```

### Custom Logout page

- **What is is:** Fowards the Agent to another page that is not the common flex.twilio.com page.

```
    window.Twilio.Flex.Actions.addListener('afterLogout', () => {
        window.location.href = "http://www.google.com";
        });
```

## Blog posts

### Show a Survey once a call ends

- **What is is:** Blog post showing how to store customer's surveys into Flex Insights

- **Resources:** [Github repo](https://www.twilio.com/blog/post-task-surveys-with-flex-insights)

## Common Questions

### How can I send an extra attribute from my IdP (SSO) to Flex?

As long as your SSO give the SAMLResponse with the correct attribute (like the example below), it will be saved in the Worker's attribute. [More info here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/admin-guide/setup/sso-configuration#attribute-conversion-and-data-types)

```
    <saml2:Attribute
        Name="email"
        NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:basic">
        <saml2:AttributeValue
            xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:type="xs:string">agent1@twilio.com
        </saml2:AttributeValue>
    </saml2:Attribute>
```
